### S.O.L.I.D. Design Principles
The SOLID principles were introduced by *Robert C. Martin* (also known as Uncle Bob) in his 2000 paper *“Design Principles and Design Patterns*.” These concepts were later built upon by Michael Feathers, who introduced us to the SOLID acronym. And in the last 20 years, these five principles have revolutionized the world of object-oriented programming, changing the way that we write software.

SOLID principle is an acronym that stands for 5 key principles in software development: 

S – Single Responsibility Principle 
O – Open Closed Principle 
L – Liskov Substitution Principle
I – Interface Segregation Principle
D – Dependency Inversion Principle

#### S – Single Responsibility Principle 
The single responsibility principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

**Benefits:**

1. **Testing** – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases.

2. **Lower coupling** – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.

3. **Organization** – Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic ones.
